## Sculptor limitations

While Sculptor is powerful, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- **Supported sources are limited** — Sculptor can only generate sources using companies, people, jobs, Google Maps, CSV imports, or web search. If you want to use a different source, you'll need to manually create it before using Sculptor.
- **No direct CRM integration (yet)** — Connections must be set up manually for now.
- **Cross-table operations are limited** — Advanced linking and workflows are still in development.
- **No export option** — Export functionality hasn't been integrated yet.
- **No write capabilities yet** — You can create new tables, but can't modify existing ones.
- **Feature gaps** — Signals tables aren't currently supported.
- **Data boundaries apply** — Only processes data you provide or data from supported sources and enrichments.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="When should I use Sculptor instead of building manually?">
Sculptor can be helpful throughout the building process, and you can freely turn it on and off as you make progress. Sculptor excels at generating lists via natural language and building new enrichments from scratch. Note that you can always edit or extend workflows manually while working with Sculptor.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I not use Sculptor?">
- **When you're building on a feature that's not yet supported, such as Signals or Clay Sequencer.**
- **When you need a complete workflow immediately.** Sculptor isn't designed to create entire workflows with a single request (it doesn't create "one-shot workflows"). Instead, it works as your partner throughout the building process. While Sculptor excels as an ideation partner, it's best at accelerating your existing work rather than replacing it.
