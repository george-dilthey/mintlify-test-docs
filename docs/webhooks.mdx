## Overview

Webhooks enable Clay to automatically receive data from other applications through HTTP POST requests in JSON format whenever specific events occur.

Your table updates instantly with new data, eliminating manual entry. This is particularly valuable for real-time updates, such as when adding new leads or modifying records based on external triggers.

## Creating a table with webhook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a webhook source">
    In a workbook, click **+ Add** at the bottom. Search for **Webhooks** and click **Monitor webhook**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the URL or cURL">
    - **URL**: Paste this URL into the application sending data to Clay. This is where your data will be sent.
    - **cURL**: Paste the cURL command into your command line to send data directly to Clay.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add authentication (optional)">
    To secure your webhook, you can include an authentication token in the header of your request.

    <Warning>Make sure to copy the token immediately — you can only access authentication tokens once.</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Webhook sources are limited to **50,000 submissions**, and this limit persists even after deleting rows. Once you reach this limit, you'll need to create a new webhook to continue receiving data.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Enterprise Plan**: Enable auto-delete (also called passthrough tables) to automatically process and delete rows, allowing unlimited webhook submissions. Learn more in [table management settings](https://university.clay.com/docs/table-management-settings).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When should I use webhooks?">
    Use webhooks when you need real-time data updates from external applications. Common use cases include:
    - **Form submissions**: Automatically add new leads when someone fills out a form in Typeform, HubSpot, or other tools
    - **CRM events**: Trigger workflows when a deal stage changes or a contact is updated
    - **Third-party integrations**: Receive data from any application that supports outbound webhooks
    - **Custom automations**: Connect internal tools or scripts that need to push data to Clay
    
    Webhooks are ideal when you want data to flow into Clay immediately as events happen, rather than manually importing or scheduling syncs.
